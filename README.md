* I'm an avid gamer. I play a mix of games from rpgs to sports. My favorite game is rocket league, which I have been playing at a very mediocre level for the last eight years.
* I am very fond of writing code, but not yet sure for what purpose I'm most interested. Most of my programming experience is in data analytics. 
* History is very interesting to me, and it mainly manifests itself in listening to podcasts. I have a lot of unecessary knowledge about antiquity and most of my political leanings are defined by history and current foreign affairs.
### Technical Background
I graduated from MSU with a Bachelor of Science in physics. At MSU, I researched with the ATLAS collaboration from Jan 2021 to Oct 2023 analyzing "trigger" algorithms for ATLAS' research at the LHC. This consisted of data analysis using python and some C++. If you're curious, feel free to ask me about it before or after class sometime... I could go on forever about this (I'm the student who arrived late and sweaty the first day). Beyond this, I have more data analytics and modeling experience from classwork at MSU. Lastly, I worked with React, Flask, and SQLite to design a personal assistant that does not work very well. I'm excited that my team agreed to rework this pet project for this semester's term project!
