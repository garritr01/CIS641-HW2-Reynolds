            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>
                I'm an avid gamer. I play a mix of games from rpgs to sports. My favorite game is rocket league, which I have been
                playing at a very mediocre level for the last eight years.

                History is very interesting to me, and it mainly manifests itself in listening to podcasts. I have a lot of unecessary
                knowledge about antiquity and most of my political leanings are defined by history and current foreign affairs.

        <h3>Technical Background</h3>
        <p class="p16">
            I graduated from MSU with a Bachelor of Science in physics. At MSU, I researched with the ATLAS collaboration from Jan
            2021 to Oct 2023 analyzing "trigger" algorithms for ATLAS' research at the LHC. This consisted of data analysis using
            python and some C++. If you're curious, feel free to ask me about it before or after class sometime... I could go on
            forever about this (I'm the student who arrived late and sweaty the first day). Beyond this, I have more data analytics
            and modeling experience from classwork at MSU. Lastly, I worked with React, Flask, and SQLite to design a personal
            assistant that does not work very well. I'm excited that my team agreed to rework this pet project for this semester's
            term project!
        </p>

            Term Project Summary - <a href="https://garritr01.github.io/GVSU-CIS641-VAR_Group/">Website</a>

        <p class="p16">
            VAR Group's goal is the creation a system that allows the user to schedule,
            record, and analyze data from their life easily and in one place.

            <div class="bulletList">
            <p>
                Scheduling - The user can schedule events on specific days, or recurring
                daily, weekly, monthly, or annually and be reminded an hour
                ahead of time if desired.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recording - The user can design an interface specific to the event for
                specific data collection of repeated events, or just notes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Analysis - The user can visualize time usage and filter events by the 
                data they've collected and compare other data points based on this 
                filtration.

            This project will both produce a personally beneficial system, and allow me
            to gain invaluable experience. Designing software for deployment in a team is
            a new experience for me that I expect to gain valuable programming and project
            management experience from.
